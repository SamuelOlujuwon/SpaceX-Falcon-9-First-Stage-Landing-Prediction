# SpaceX-Falcon-9-First-Stage-Landing-Prediction.

## This repository is to predict if SpaceX Falcon 9 rockets first stage will land successfully after rocket launches.

SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of $62 million. Other providers cost upward of $165 million dollars each and much of the savings on SpaceX's rocket launches, is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage of its rockets. If we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

## Data collection through Webscraping and Data wrangling.

### Objectives

Write Python code to manipulate data in a Pandas dataframe.

Create a Python Pandas dataframe by converting a JSON file.

Create a Jupyter Notebook and make it sharable using GitHub.

Use Data Science methodologies to define and resolve a real-world business problem.

Use Data Analysis tools to load a dataset, refine it, and uncover insights from it.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

Convert the data into a dataframe and then do some data wrangling.

### Objectives

Create scatter plots and bar charts, using Python to analyze data in a Pandas dataframe.

Write Python code to conduct Exploratory Aata Analysis by manipulating data in a Pandas dataframe.

Write and execute SQL queries to select and sort data.

Visualize the data and extract meaningful patterns to guide the modeling process.

## Interactive Visualizations.

Build an interactive map to analyze the launch site proximity with Folium and build a dashboard to analyze launch records interactively with Plotly Dash.

### Objectives

Build an interactive map to analyze the launch site proximity with Folium.

Generate interactive maps, calculate distance, plot coordinates, and mark clusters by writing Python code using Folium.

Build an interactive dashboard that contains pie charts and scatter plots to analyze data with Plotly Dash.

Build a dashboard to analyze launch records interactively with Plotly Dash.

## Landing Prediction via Classification.

Use Machine Learning to determine if the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully. The data will be split into test and training data to find the best classification models / parameters from Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Trees and K Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Thereafter, find the method that performs best with the test data.

### Objectives

Split the data into test and training data.

Train and deploy different classification models / parameters.

Express hyperparameter grid search and the accuracy of different classification models / parameters.

Use Machine Learning to build a predictive model to aid launch predictions and answer the business problem.
